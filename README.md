# Unnecessary Rethrow in Dart Async Function

This repository demonstrates a potential issue with unnecessary `rethrow` statements in Dart asynchronous functions.

The `bug.dart` file shows code that uses `rethrow` within a `catch` block. In many cases, this is redundant, leading to less clear error handling and potentially obscuring the root cause of the exception.

The `bugSolution.dart` provides an improved version that removes the unnecessary `rethrow`, simplifying error handling and making debugging easier.  The solution shows how to directly handle exceptions without needing to rethrow unless specific higher-level handling is required in other parts of the app.

## How to reproduce

1. Clone the repository.
2. Run `bug.dart` and observe the output.
3. Run `bugSolution.dart` and compare the output and error handling.

## Key improvements

- Avoiding unnecessary complexity in error handling
- More straightforward debugging
- Enhanced readability
